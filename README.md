Assigment explanation in points:
-This is a real life poster converted to html/css/javascript.
-The static poster has been extended with some possibilities that the web brings. This includes interactive elements.
-The poster is an artwork with objects which don't clearly represent anything but I think people tend to see something in it.
-I went with the 'flying creatures' angle and created some extra features with that in mind. There are also some other cool features.
-My idea behind this web artwork is also to make the user explore. Which is why it at first isn't really clear where you can click to make something happen.
